features:
  - title: Semantic templates
    details:
      Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.
  - title: Mustache-compatible
    details:
      Handlebars is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with
      Handlebars and continue using your current templates.
  - title: Fast execution
    details:
      Handlebars compiles templates into JavaScript functions. This makes the template execution faster than most other
      template engines.
