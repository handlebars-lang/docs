# Precompiling templates

Using the Handlebars precompiler, you can precompile your Handlebars templates to save time on the client and reduce the
required runtime size of the handlebars library.

## Getting started

First, you will need to have _Node.js and npm_. Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
to find out how to do that on your OS.

Next, install the Handlebars npm package, which contains the precompiler.

```bash
npm install -g handlebars
```

Create a file name `example.handlebars` containing your template:

<<< @/src/usage-examples/precompilation/example.handlebars

Run the precompiler.

```bash
handlebars example.handlebars -f example.precompiled.js
```

Include the Handlebars runtime and the precompile javascript.

<<< @/src/usage-examples/precompilation/index.html

The runtime is also available for download on the [installation page](index.md#downloading-handlebars).

## Optimizations

Because you are precompiling templates, you can also apply several optimization to the compiler. The first allows you to
specify a list of the known helpers to the compiler

```bash
handlebars <input> -f <output> -k each -k if -k unless
```

The Handlebars compiler will optimize accesses to those helpers for performance. When all helpers are known at compile
time, the `--knownOnly` option provides the smallest generated code that also provides the fastest execution.

## Usage

!HANDLEBARS_HELP!

If using the precompiler's normal mode, the resulting templates will be stored to the Handlebars.templates object using
the relative template name sans the extension. These templates may be executed in the same manner as templates. If using
the simple mode the precompiler will generate a single javascript method. To execute this method it must be passed to
the `Handlebars.template()` method and the resulting object may be used as normal.

## Precompiling Templates Inside NodeJS

If you wish to precompile templates from inside NodeJS--without invoking "handlebars" from the command line--that can be
done with Handlebars.precompile. Transmit the string result of this function to your clients, and they can in turn parse
that with Handlebars.template.

<<< @/src/usage-examples/precompilation/precompile-in-nodejs.js

The output will be the following:

<<< @/src/usage-examples/precompilation/precompile-in-nodejs.output.js

On the client side you have Javascript along the lines of the following.

```js
Handlebars.partials["test1"] = Handlebars.template({
  /** insert compiled output here **/
});
```

Finally, you can reference these templates dynamically in your Javascript.

```js
var result = Handlebars.partials["test1"]({ name: "yourname" });
// do whatever you want with the result
```

## Integrations

Some npm-packages can be used to integrate the Handlebars precompiler into your build system (i.e. Webpack,
Browserify...). Have a look at the integrations page:
