# Why vuepress?

There are a lot of static page generators out there nowadays. I have chosen [vuepress](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org) over other systems for several reasons:

* I like [vuejs](https://vuejs.org).
* Vuepress builds fast loading static sites with modern PWA technologies.
* Vuepress is centered around markdown, but leaves the opportunity to inject interactive parts if needed
* Vuepress has a simple predefined way of adapting stylesheets, which makes it easy to adapt colors from the 
  original site without rewriting the whole css
* The vuejs documentation site is build with vuepress, so it will hopefully be around for a while.

You can challenge me and propose other solutions, but you might be asked to help out if you do.
