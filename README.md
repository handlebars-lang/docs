# Why VitePress?

There are a lot of static page generators out there nowadays.
I have chosen [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) over other systems for several reasons:

* I like [vuejs](https://vuejs.org).
* VitePress builds fast loading static sites with modern PWA technologies.
* VitePress is centered around markdown, but leaves the opportunity to inject interactive parts if needed.
* VitePress has a simple predefined way of adapting stylesheets, which makes it easy to adapt colors from the 
  original site without rewriting the whole css
* The vuejs documentation site is build with VitePress, so it will hopefully be around for a while.

You can challenge me and propose other solutions, but you might be asked to help out if you do.
